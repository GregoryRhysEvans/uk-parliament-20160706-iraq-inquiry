Executive SummaryIntroduction
in an opposed invasion and full‑scale occupation of a sovereign State – Iraq. Cabinet 
decided on 17 March to join the US‑led invasion of Iraq, assuming there was no 
last‑minute capitulation by Saddam Hussein. That decision was ratified by Parliament 
the next day and implemented the night after that.

the UK sought to assist with stabilisation and reconstruction.

and many individuals wounded, mentally as well as physically. After harsh deprivation 
under Saddam Hussein’s regime, the Iraqi people suffered further years of violence.

provoked profound controversy in relation to Iraq and became even more controversial 
when it was subsequently found that Iraq’s programmes to develop and produce 
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons had been dismantled. It continues to shape 
debates on national security policy and the circumstances in which to intervene.

defied the United Nations and which was seen as a threat to peace and security, it 
failed to achieve the goals it had set for a new Iraq. Faced with serious disorder in Iraq, 
aggravated by sectarian differences, the US and UK struggled to contain the situation. 
The lack of security impeded political, social and economic reconstruction. 

the period from when the possibility of military action first arose in 2001 to the departure 
of UK troops in 2009. It covers many different aspects of policy and its delivery.

that have been central to the controversies surrounding Iraq. In addition to the factors 
that shaped the decision to take military action in March 2003 without support for an 
authorising resolution in the UN Security Council, they are: the assessments of Iraqi 
WMD capabilities by the intelligence community prior to the invasion (including their 
presentation in the September 2002 dossier); advice on whether military action would be 
legal; the lack of adequate preparation for the post‑conflict period and the consequent 
struggle to cope with the deteriorating security situation in Iraq after the invasion. 
This Summary also contains the Inquiry’s key findings and a compilation of lessons, from 
the conclusions of individual Sections of the report.

events, and the Inquiry’s full conclusions and lessons. 


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry9.  The following are extracts from the main body of the Report covering some of the 
most important issues considered by the Inquiry.

Pre‑conflict strategy and planning
in Afghanistan in November, the US Administration turned its attention to regime change 
in Iraq as part of the second phase of what it called the Global War on Terror.

avoid unilateral US military action on Iraq by offering partnership to the US and seeking 
to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat with which it was 
necessary to deal. 

essential demonstration of solidarity with the UK’s principal ally as well as being in the 
UK’s long‑term national interests.

by peaceful means, with the US goal of regime change. That was achieved by the 
development of an ultimatum strategy threatening the use of force if Saddam Hussein 
did not comply with the demands of the international community, and by seeking to 
persuade the US to adopt that strategy and pursue it through the UN.

Iraq, and the subsequent successful negotiation of resolution 1441 giving Iraq a final 
opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations or face serious consequences 
if it did not, was perceived to be a major success for Mr Blair’s strategy and his influence 
on President Bush.

of 7 December 2002, the UK perceived that President Bush had decided that the US 
would take military action in early 2003 if Saddam Hussein had not been disarmed and 
was still in power.


by mid‑March. President Bush agreed to support a second resolution to help Mr Blair.

from those countries, notably France, Germany and Russia, which believed that the 
inspections process could continue. The inspectors reported that Iraqi co‑operation, 
while far from perfect, was improving.


Executive Summary19.  By early March, the US Administration was not prepared to allow inspections 
to continue or give Mr Blair more time to try to achieve support for action. The attempt 
to gain support for a second resolution was abandoned. 

Military action was therefore not a last resort. 

with a stark choice. It could act with the US but without the support of the majority 
of the Security Council in taking military action if Saddam Hussein did not accept 
the US ultimatum giving him 48 hours to leave. Or it could choose not to join US‑led 
military action.

of force. Parliament endorsed that choice.

defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and his assumed weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) programmes. However, based on consistent legal advice, the UK 
could not share the US objective of regime change. The UK Government therefore set 
as its objective the disarmament of Iraq in accordance with the obligations imposed in a 
series of Security Council resolutions.

UK policy before 9/11
a strategy of containment based on a new sanctions regime to improve international 
support and incentivise Iraq’s co‑operation, narrowing and deepening the sanctions 
regime to focus only on prohibited items and at the same time improving financial 
controls to reduce the flow of illicit funds to Saddam Hussein.

Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy (DOP) in May 1999, the objectives towards 
Iraq were defined as: 

“... in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam poses to the region including 
by eliminating his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes; and, in 


The Report of the Iraq Inquirythe longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law‑abiding member 
of the international community.”.1 

objectives. A “policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international 
support”. Iraq was unlikely to accept the package immediately but “might be persuaded 
to acquiesce eventually”.

Commission (UNMOVIC) (which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed 
to lead);

operation of the containment policy (see Section 1.2). There were concerns about how 
long the policy could be sustained and what it could achieve. 

No‑Fly Zones (NFZs) and the conduct of individual operations.4 



Executive Summary36.  In an Assessment on 1 November, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) judged 
that Saddam Hussein felt “little pressure to negotiate over ... resolution 1284 because 
the proceeds of oil smuggling and illicit trade have increased significantly this year, and 
more countries are increasing diplomatic contacts and trade with Iraq”.5 


“Saddam would only contemplate co‑operation with [resolution] 1284, and the return 
of inspectors ... if it could be portrayed as a victory. He will not agree to co‑operate 
unless:
•  there is a UN‑agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions. Saddam suspects 
•  he is able to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection

programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any other constraints

“Before accepting 1284, Saddam will try to obtain the abolition of the No‑Fly Zones. 
He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the 
Iraqi regime.”

implementation of 1284, enabling inspectors to return and sanctions to be suspended.6

to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, 
but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by 
President Clinton.7 


•  There was “broad international consensus to maintain the arms embargo 
at least as long as Saddam remains in power. Saddam faces no economic 
pressure to accept ... [resolution] 1284 because he is successfully 
undermining the economic sanctions regime.”

•  “Through abuse of the UN Oil‑for‑Food [OFF] programme and smuggling of 

oil and other goods” it was estimated that Saddam Hussein would “be able to 
appropriate in the region of $1.5bn to $1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001”, 
and there was “scope for earning even more”.



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry•  “Iranian interdiction efforts” had “significantly reduced smuggling down 

the Gulf”, but Saddam Hussein had “compensated by exploiting land routes 
to Turkey and Syria”. 

•  “Most countries” believed that economic sanctions were “ineffective, 

counterproductive and should now be lifted. Without active enforcement, 
the economic sanctions regime” would “continue to erode”.8

•  Saddam Hussein needed funds “to maintain his military and security apparatus 
•  Despite the availability of funds, Iraq had been slow to comply with UN 
recommendations on food allocation. Saddam needed “the Iraqi people 
to suffer to underpin his campaign against sanctions”.

•  Encouraged by the success of Iraq’s border trade agreement with Turkey, 
•  There had been a “significant increase in the erosion of sanctions over

the past six months”.

February 2001, the US and UK agreed on the need for a policy which was more widely 
supported in the Middle East region.9 Mr Blair had concluded that public presentation 
needed to be improved. He suggested that the approach should be presented as a 
“deal” comprising four elements:

•  do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel;
•  tighten weapons controls on Saddam Hussein;
•  retain financial control on Saddam Hussein; and
•  retain our ability to strike.

US, China, France and Russia, the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council.



Executive Summary45.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, until 11 September 2001, the UK had a policy of 
containment, but sanctions were eroding.12 The policy was “partially successful”, 
but it did not mean that Saddam Hussein was “not still developing his [prohibited]

to the return of inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999). 



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry53.  The adoption on 29 November 2001 of resolution 1382 went some way towards that 
objective. But support for economic sanctions was eroding and whether Iraq would ever 
agree to re‑admit weapons inspectors and allow them to operate without obstruction was 
in doubt.

strategy to confront terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. He sought to prevent precipitate

to comply.

that President Bush had asked General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief, 
US Central Command, to review the military options for removing Saddam Hussein, 
including options for a conventional ground invasion. 

That remained a key part of his position in the months that followed.



Executive Summary64.  In his annual State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002, President Bush 
described the regimes in North Korea and Iran as “sponsors of terrorism”.18 He added 
that Iraq had continued to:

“... flaunt its hostility towards America and to support terror ... The Iraqi regime has 
plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. 
This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own 
citizens ... This is a regime that agreed to international inspections – then kicked out 
the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.”


“States like these [North Korea, Iran and Iraq], and their terrorist allies, constitute an 
axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass 
destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.” 

was a threat which had to be dealt with. Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed.

ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological warfare 
capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its capabilities, 
including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was pursuing an active 
policy of deception and concealment. It also reflected the wider context in which the 
policy was being discussed with the US.

Service, advised that the US Administration had concluded that containment would 
not work, was drawing up plans for a military campaign later in the year, and was 
considering presenting Saddam Hussein with an ultimatum for the return of inspectors 
while setting the bar “so high that Saddam Hussein would be unable to comply”.19

such an attack as inevitable; and that Iraqi opposition groups would not act without

delivered to Saddam Hussein as “change the regime attitude on WMD inspections or

with President Bush at Crawford, Mr Blair had set out a number of considerations 
in relation to the development of policy on Iraq. These were variously described as:

•  The UN inspectors needed to be given every chance of success.
•  The US should take action within a multilateral framework with international 

support, not unilateral action.

was seeking a commitment from the Security Council to take action in the event that 
Saddam Hussein refused or subsequently obstructed the inspectors.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry104.  In his press conference at Sedgefield on 3 September, Mr Blair indicated that time 
and patience were running out and that there were difficulties with the existing policy of 
containment.33 He also announced the publication of the Iraq dossier, stating that: 

“... people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that 
Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose. He [Saddam Hussein] is without any 
question, still trying to develop that chemical, biological, potentially nuclear capability 
and to allow him to do so without any let or hindrance, just to say, we [sic] can carry 
on and do it, I think would be irresponsible.” 


Administration had been left in no doubt that the UK Government needed the issue 
of Iraq to be taken back to the Security Council before it would be able to participate 
in military action in Iraq.

came to war, the UK would take a significant military role. 

his view of the “grave and gathering danger” posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged 
the UN to act to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security 
Council since 1990.36 He made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN, the world must hold 
Iraq to account and the US would “work with the UN Security Council for the necessary

Executive Summary112.  The Government dossier on Iraq was published on 24 September.37 It was

Government’s policy that action was urgently required to secure Iraq’s disarmament.

arguments to make clear his perception of the threat and why he believed that there 
was an “overwhelming” case for action to disarm Iraq.

but not before, to admit the weapons inspectors, Mr Blair stated that the answer was in 
the dossier, and it was because:

“... his chemical, biological and nuclear programme is not an historic left‑over from 
of mass destruction programme is active detailed and growing. The policy of 
containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not 
shut down; it is up and running now.”

and “Why should Britain care?”

Hussein stood out: “He had used these weapons in Iraq” and thousands had died, and 
he had used them during the war with Iran “in which one million people died”; and the 
regime had “no moderate elements to appeal to”.


“I agree I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam will 
use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made 
the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs 
its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a 
weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act, 
will use diplomacy but not force. We know, again from our history, that diplomacy 
not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will.”

US and France and Russia (described by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent

out in UNSCRs [UN Security Council resolutions]. This would reduce Iraq’s ability 
to threaten its neighbours and the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its

Executive Summary177.  Reporting discussions in New York on 26 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote 
that there was “a general antipathy to having now to take decisions on this issue, and 
a wariness about what our underlying motives are behind the resolution”.73 Sir Jeremy 
concluded that the US was focused on preserving its room for manoeuvre while he 
was “concentrating on trying to win votes”. It was the “middle ground” that mattered. 
Mexico and Chile were the “pivotal sceptics”. 

future military action would be to secure a further Security Council resolution.74 He had, 
however, reached the view that a “reasonable case” could be made that resolution 1441 
was capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 (1990) without a 
further resolution, if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed 
to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.

divisions in the Security Council had grown not reduced; and that the “dynamics of 
disagreement” were producing new alliances.79 France, Germany and Russia were 
moving to create an alternative pole of power and influence.

as I did; and they weren’t prepared to indulge the US, as they saw it.”

the US and that:

“... [W]e should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. First to make 
the moral case for removing Saddam ... Second, to try one more time to reunite 
the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of a 
continuing breach.” 

and permit interviews; and an amnesty if Saddam Hussein left Iraq by 21 March.80

without a second resolution was palpably “very low”. In that circumstance, even if a 
majority in the Security Council had voted for the resolution with only France exercising 
its veto, he was “increasingly pessimistic” about support within the Labour Party for 
military action.81 The debate in the UK was: 

“... significantly defined by the tone of the debate in Washington and particularly 
remarks made by the President and others to the right of him, which suggested that 
the US would go to war whatever and was not bothered about a second resolution 
one way or another.” 


“... was concerned that, having shifted world (and British) public opinion over the 
months, it had now been seriously set back in recent days. We were not in the right 
position. The Prime Minister was considering a number of ideas which he might well 
put to the President.”82 

to make proposals, he should do so quickly. The US was not enthusiastic about the 
inclusion of an immunity clause for Saddam Hussein in the resolution.

a vetoed resolution would no longer be possible for the UK. Mr Straw said that without 
a second resolution approval for military action could be “beyond reach”. 



Executive Summary192.  Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) on 4 March that it was “a matter 
of fact” that Iraq had been in material breach “for some weeks” and resolution 1441 
provided sufficient legal authority to justify military action against Iraq if it was “in further 
material breach”.83

France’s main aim was to “avoid being put on the spot” by influencing the undecided, 
preventing the US and UK mustering nine votes, and keeping alongside the Russians

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry200.  The British Embassy Washington reported overnight on 5/6 March that “barring

“It was worth having one last‑ditch chance to see if you could bring people back

circumstances of breach – that was the tests that we applied with Hans Blix – get 
the Americans to agree to the resolution, get the French to agree that you couldn’t

“My position is that, regardless of the circumstances, France will vote ‘no’ because 
she considers this evening that there are no grounds for waging war in order to

Executive Summary241.  By 11 March, it was clear that, in the time available before the US was going to 
take military action, it would be difficult to secure nine votes in the Security Council 
for a resolution determining that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by 
resolution 1441.


“If we cannot gain nine votes and be sure of no veto, we should not push our 
second resolution to a vote. The political and diplomatic consequences for the UK 
would be significantly worse to have our ... resolution defeated ... than if we camp 
on 1441 ...”111

pushing the issue to a vote “if we had nine votes and faced only a French veto”, 
the more he “thought about this, the worse an idea it becomes”.

•  The “best, least risky way to gain a moral majority” was “by the ‘Kosovo route’ –

They discussed the impact of President Chirac’s “veto threats”. Mr Blair considered that

“So when I look back ... I know there was never any way Britain was not going to 
be with the US at that moment, once we went down the UN route and Saddam was 
in breach. Of course such a statement is always subject to in extremis correction. 
A crazy act of aggression? No, we would not have supported that. But given the 
history, you couldn’t call Saddam a crazy target.

In his view, the issue mattered “so much” because the outcome would not just determine 
the fate of the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi people but would:

threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship

regimes with weapons of mass destruction and extreme terrorist groups” prepared 
to use them.

•  “dictatorships with highly repressive regimes” who were “desperately trying to

weapon”, and that activity was increasing, not diminishing; and

•  the possibility of terrorist groups obtaining and using weapons of mass 

destruction, including a “radiological bomb”.

“fully” that the association between the two was:

“... loose – but it is hardening. The possibility of the two coming together – of terrorist

radiological bomb – is now in my judgement, a real and present danger to Britain 
and its national security.”

his weapons, they pose a clear danger to British citizens ...”

concerns about mass‑casualty terrorism was at the heart of the Government’s case 
for taking action at this time against Iraq. 

•  The proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their delivery 
systems, particularly ballistic missiles, was regarded as a major threat. But Iran, 
North Korea and Libya were of greater concern than Iraq in terms of the risk of 
nuclear and missile proliferation.

•  JIC Assessments, reflected in the September 2002 dossier, had consistently 
taken the view that, if sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would 
take Iraq at least five years following the end of sanctions to produce enough 
fissile material for a weapon. On 7 March, the IAEA had reported to the Security 
Council that there was no indication that Iraq had resumed its nuclear activities. 
•  The September dossier stated that Iraq could produce a nuclear weapon within 
one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other essential components

fissile material and other components or – were it able to do so – that it had the 
technical capabilities to turn these materials into a usable weapon.

•  JIC Assessments had identified the possible stocks of chemical and biological 
weapons which would largely have been for short‑range, battlefield use by the 
Iraqi armed forces. The JIC had also judged in the September dossier that Iraq 
was producing chemical and biological agents and that there were development

•  Evidence of contact between Iraq and Usama Bin Laden (UBL) was 

“fragmentary and uncorroborated”; including that Iraq had been in contact 
with Al Qaida for exploratory discussions on toxic materials in late 1988.

•  “With common enemies ... there was clearly scope for collaboration.” 
•  There was “no evidence that these contacts led to practical co‑operation;

that, in the event of US‑led military action against Iraq, Saddam would: 

“... aim to use terrorism or the threat of it. Fearing the US response, he is likely to 
weigh the costs and benefits carefully in deciding the timing and circumstances in 
which terrorism is used. But intelligence on Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in this 
field is limited.”

the “threat from terrorism from Saddam’s own intelligence apparatus in the event of an 
intervention in Iraq ... was judged to be limited and containable”.151 

from 2002 to 2007, confirmed that position, stating that the Security Service felt there 
was “a pretty good intelligence picture of a threat from Iraq within the UK and to 
British interests”.152

•  “We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years – contrary to 
all history, contrary to all intelligence – Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy 
those weapons. I say that such a claim is palpably absurd.”

•  “Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood 
sense of the term – namely a credible device capable of being delivered against 
a strategic city target. It probably ... has biological toxins and battlefield chemical 
munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold 
Saddam anthrax agents and the then British Government approved chemical and 
munitions factories. Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action 
to disarm a military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and which we 
helped to create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddam’s 
ambition to complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of 
UN inspectors?”155

“... not accept, even with hindsight, that we were wrong to act as we did in the 
circumstances that we faced at the time. Even after reading all the evidence detailed 
by the Iraq Survey Group, it is still hard to believe that any regime could behave 
in so self‑destructive a manner as to pretend that it had forbidden weaponry, when 
in fact it had not.”156

military action against Iraq will come from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists”; and 
they would be “pursuing their own agenda”.158 


•  Al Qaida and associated networks would remain the greatest terrorist threat 
to the UK and its activity would increase at the onset of any military action 
against Iraq.

•  In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material 

could be transferred to terrorists, including Al Qaida.159


“... Al Qaida and associated groups will continue to represent by far the 
greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat will be heightened 
by military action against Iraq. The broader threat from Islamist terrorists will also 
increase in the event of war, reflecting intensified anti‑US/anti‑Western sentiment in 
the Muslim world, including among Muslim communities in the West. And there is a 
risk that the transfer of CB [chemical and biological] material or expertise, during or 
in the aftermath of conflict, will enhance Al Qaida’s capabilities.”

and Security Committee (ISC) later that year that:

“One of the most difficult aspects of this is that there was obviously a danger that 
in attacking Iraq you ended up provoking the very thing you were trying to avoid. 
On the other hand I think you had to ask the question, ‘Could you really, as a 
result of that fear, leave the possibility that in time developed into a nexus between 
terrorism and WMD in an event?’ This is where you’ve just got to make your 
judgement about this. But this is my judgement and it remains my judgement 
and I suppose time will tell whether it’s true or it’s not true.”163


“... attention to the difficult judgement that had to be made and the factors on both 
sides of the argument to be taken into account.”164


“By 2003/2004 we were receiving an increasing number of leads to terrorist activity 
from within the UK ... our involvement in Iraq radicalised, for want of a better word ... 
a few among a generation ... [who] saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our 
involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam.”165

to forestall a fusion of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism at 
some point in the future, and if it had eliminated a threat of terrorism from his regime, 
Baroness Manningham‑Buller replied:

“It eliminated the threat of terrorism from his direct regime; it didn’t eliminate the 
threat of terrorism using unconventional methods ... So using weapons of mass 
destruction as a terrorist weapon is still a potential threat.

“After all Usama Bin Laden said it was the duty of members of his organisation 
or those in sympathy with it to acquire and use these weapons. It is interesting 
that ... such efforts as we have seen to get access to these sort of materials have 
been low‑grade and not very professional, but it must be a cause of concern to my 
former colleagues that at some stage terrorist groups will resort to these methods. 



Executive SummaryIn that respect, I don’t think toppling Saddam Hussein is germane to the long‑term 
ambitions of some terrorist groups to use them.”166

Hussein would probably have brought together international terrorism and weapons 
of mass destruction in a threat to Western interests, Baroness Manningham‑Buller 
responded:

“It is a hypothetical theory. It certainly wasn’t of concern in either the short‑term 
or the medium‑term to my colleagues and myself.”167

communicated by the JIC Assessments.168

JIC Assessments they could “have had no doubt” about that risk.169 She said that by the 
time of the July 2005 attacks in London:

“... an increasing number of British‑born individuals ... were attracted to the ideology 
of Usama Bin Laden and saw the West’s activities in Iraq and Afghanistan as 
threatening their fellow religionists and the Muslim world.” 

the terrorist threat to the UK was based on hard evidence or a broader assessment, 
Baroness Manningham‑Buller replied:

“I think we can produce evidence because of the numerical evidence of the number 
of plots, the number of leads, the number of people identified, and the correlation of 
that to Iraq and statements of people as to why they were involved ... So I think the 
answer to your ... question: yes.”170 

Assessment of 10 February 2002, and what weight he had given to it when he decided

“I was aware of the JIC Assessment of 10 February that the Al Qaida threat to the 
UK would increase. But I took the view then and take the same view now that to 
have backed down because of the threat of terrorism would be completely wrong.

Mr Blair rightly attached great importance to preserving and strengthening it.

to bring about the fall of the Taliban served to strengthen and deepen the sense of

between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and 
the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could

“I knew in the final analysis I would be with the US, because it was right morally 
and strategically. But we should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution.

this to compare notes and inject his views on the major issues of the day, and it is clear

President. There was also a very active channel between his Foreign Affairs Adviser and 
the President’s National Security Advisor. Mr Blair also sent detailed written Notes to the 
President.


“... the Prime Minister had a habit of writing notes, both internally and to President

Collective responsibility
Government – Cabinet is the main mechanism by which the most senior members 
of the Government take collective responsibility for its most important decisions. 
Cabinet is supported by a system of Ministerial Committees whose role is to identify, 
test and develop policy options; analyse and mitigate risks; and debate and hone policy 
proposals until they are endorsed across the Government.178 


“The Cabinet is supported by Ministerial Committees (both standing and ad hoc) 
which have a two‑fold purpose. First, they relieve the pressure on the Cabinet 
itself by settling as much business as possible at a lower level or, failing that, 
by clarifying the issues and defining the points of disagreement. Second, they 
support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though an 
important question may never reach the Cabinet itself, the decision will be fully

Government as a whole can properly be expected to accept responsibility for it.”179 


“The business of the Cabinet and Ministerial Committees consists in the main of:

Government because they raise major issues of policy or because they 
are of critical importance to the public;

b.  questions on which there is an unresolved argument between

characteristic way of working with his Cabinet colleagues as: 

“… ‘I like to move fast. I don’t want to spend a lot of time in kind of conflict resolution, 
and, therefore, I will get the people who will make this thing move quickly and 
efficiently.’ That was his sort of characteristic style, but it has drawbacks.”185

“a professional forum ... they had ... with one possible exception [Ms Clare Short, the 
International Development Secretary], the right people in the room. It wasn’t the kind 
of sofa government in the sense of the Prime Minister and his special advisers and 
political cronies”.186



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry403.  In July 2004, Lord Butler’s Report stated that his Committee was:

“... concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the Government’s 
procedures which we saw in the context of policy‑making towards Iraq risks reducing 
the scope for informed collective political judgement. Such risks are particularly 
significant in a field like the subject of our Review, where hard facts are inherently 
difficult to come by and the quality of judgement is accordingly all the more 
important.”187 


“... where a small group is brought together to work on operational military planning 
and developing the diplomatic strategy, in future such a group will operate formally 
as an ad hoc Cabinet Committee.”188 

deployments, particularly where they will have implications for the responsibilities of 
more than one Cabinet Minister, are likely to be controversial, and/or are likely to give 
rise to significant risks, the options should be considered by a group of Ministers meeting 
regularly, whether or not they are formally designated as a Cabinet Committee, so that 
Cabinet as a whole can be enabled to take informed collective decisions.


“Most of the important decisions of the Blair Government were taken either in 
informal meetings of Ministers and officials or by Cabinet Committees ... Unlike 
the full Cabinet, a Cabinet Committee has the right people present, including, 
for example, the military Chiefs of Staff or scientific advisers, its members are 
well briefed, it can take as long as it likes over its discussion on the basis of 
well‑prepared papers, and it is independently chaired by a senior Minister with 
no departmental vested interest.”189

when it is working well. In particular, it recognises the important function which a 
Minister without departmental responsibilities for the issues under consideration can 
play. This can provide some external challenge from experienced members of the 
government and mitigate any tendency towards group‑think. In the case of Iraq, for 
example, the inclusion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Deputy Prime Minister, 
as senior members of the Cabinet, or of Mr Cook, as a former Foreign Secretary known 
to have concerns about the policy, could have provided an element of challenge.



Executive Summary408.  Mr Powell likewise recognises the importance of having written advice which can 
be seen before a meeting, allowing all those present to have shared information and 
the opportunity to digest it and seek further advice if necessary. This allows the time in 
meetings to be used productively.

Cabinet Committee or small group of Ministers on the basis of inter‑departmental advice 
agreed at a senior level between officials at a number of decision points which had a 
major impact on the development of UK policy before the invasion of Iraq. Those were: 
•  The decision at the beginning of December 2001 to offer to work with President 
Bush on a strategy to deal with Iraq as part of Phase 2 of the “War on Terror”, 
despite the fact that there was no evidence of any Iraqi involvement with the 
attacks on the US or active links to Al Qaida. 

•  The adoption of the position at the end of February 2002 that Iraq was a threat 
which had to be dealt with, together with the assumption that the only certain 
means to remove Saddam Hussein and his regime was to invade Iraq and 
impose a new government. 

•  The position Mr Blair should adopt in discussions with President Bush at 
Crawford in April 2002. The meeting at Chequers on 2 April was given a 
presentation on the military options and did not explore the political and legal 
implications of a conflict with Iraq. There was no FCO representative at the 
Chequers meeting and no subsequent meeting with Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.
•  The position Mr Blair should adopt in his discussion with President Bush at 

Camp David on 5 and 6 September 2002. Mr Blair’s long Note of 28 July, telling 
President Bush “I will be with you, whatever”, was seen, before it was sent, only 
by No.10 officials. A copy was sent afterwards to Mr Straw, but not to Mr Hoon. 
While the Note was marked “Personal” (to signal that it should have a restricted 
circulation), it represented an extensive statement of the UK Government’s 
position by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States. The Foreign 
and Defence Secretaries should certainly have been given an opportunity to 
comment on the draft in advance.

found no evidence of WMD and there was only limited support for the second 
resolution in the Security Council.

of proposals before decisions were taken, a Cabinet Committee or a more structured 
process might have identified some of the wider implications and risks associated 
with the deployment of military forces to Iraq. It might also have offered the opportunity 
to remedy some of the deficiencies in planning which are identified in Section 6 of 
the Report. There will, of course, be other policy issues which would benefit from 
the same approach.



“... Cabinet is the right place to ratify decisions, the right place for people to raise 
concerns if they have not done so before, the right place for briefings by the Prime 
Minister and other Ministers on strategic issues, the right place to ensure political 
unity; but it is categorically not the right place for an informed decision on difficult 
and detailed policy issues.”190

minutes of one of its meetings under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, Mr Straw 
explained the need for frank discussion at Cabinet very cogently: 

“Serious and controversial decisions must be taken with free, frank – even blunt 
deliberations between colleagues. Dialogue must be fearless. Ministers must have 
the confidence to challenge each other in private. They must ensure that decisions 
have been properly thought through, sounding out all possibilities before committing 
themselves to a course of action. They must not feel inhibited from advancing 
options that may be unpopular or controversial. They must not be deflected from 
expressing dissent by the fear that they may be held personally to account for views 
that are later cast aside.”191



Executive Summary414.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that:

“... the discussion that we had in Cabinet was substantive discussion. We had it 
again and again and again, and the options were very simple. The options were: 
a sanctions framework that was effective; alternatively, the UN inspectors doing 
the job; alternatively, you have to remove Saddam. Those were the options.”192 


“Nobody in the Cabinet was unaware of ... what the whole issue was about. It was 
the thing running throughout the whole of the political mainstream at the time. 
There were members of the Cabinet who would challenge and disagree, but most 
of them agreed.”193

notebooks. Cabinet was certainly given updates on diplomatic developments and 
had opportunities to discuss the general issues. The number of occasions on which 
there was a substantive discussion of the policy was very much more limited.

of all the issues (as the Report sets out), in Cabinet on 7 March and 23 September 2002 
and 16 January, 13 March and 17 March 2003. Those are the records which are being 
published with the Report. 


“... the concerns expressed in discussion were justified. It was important that the 
United States did not appear to be acting unilaterally. It was critically important 
to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. Any military action taken against 
President Saddam Hussein’s regime had to be effective. On the other hand, the 
Iraqi regime was in clear breach of its obligations under several United Nations 
Security Council resolutions. Its WMD programmes posed a threat to peace. 
Iraq’s neighbours regarded President Saddam Hussein as a danger. The right 
strategy was to engage closely with the Government of the United States in order 
to be in a position to shape policy and its presentation. The international community 
should proceed in a measured but determined way to decide how to respond to the 
real threat represented by the Iraqi regime. No decisions to launch military action 
had been taken and any action taken would be in accordance with international law.

“The Cabinet, ‘Took note, with approval.’”194 



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry419.  Cabinet on 17 March 2003 noted Mr Blair’s conclusion that “the diplomatic process 
was at an end; Saddam Hussein would be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the 
House of Commons would be asked to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to 
enforce compliance, if necessary”.

by Mr Blair, before the meeting on 17 March.

in 1999:

“... the pattern of the organisation and format of Cabinet meetings was ... well 
established. Tony Blair was well known to be extremely concerned about leaks 
from Cabinet discussions ... It was my perception that, largely as a consequence 
of this, he did not normally expect key decisions to be made in the course of 
Cabinet meetings. Papers were submitted to the Cabinet Office, and in turn by 
the Cabinet Office to appropriate Cabinet Committees for decisions.”195


“At no time when I was serving in the Ministry of Defence were other Cabinet 
Ministers involved in discussions about the deployment of specific forces and 
the nature of their operations. Relevant details would have been circulated to 
recall a single Cabinet level discussion of specific troop deployments and the 
nature of their operations.”196

demonstrates, requires the Prime Minister of the UK, the Foreign Secretary and their 
most senior officials to be involved in negotiating and agreeing policy on a day‑by‑day, 
and sometimes hour‑by‑hour basis. 



Executive Summary427.  It would neither be necessary nor feasible to seek a mandate from Cabinet at 
each stage of a discussion. That reinforces the importance of ensuring Cabinet is kept 
informed as strategy evolves, is given the opportunity to raise questions and is asked to 
endorse key decisions. Cabinet Ministers need more information than will be available 
from the media, especially on sensitive issues of foreign and security policy.

Committee on the Constitution:

“... each of us, as Secretary of the Cabinet, has been constantly conscious of his 
responsibility to the Cabinet collectively and of the need to have regard to the needs 
and responsibilities of the other members of the Cabinet (and indeed of other 
Ministers) as well of those of the Prime Minister. That has coloured our relationships 
with Number 10 as well as those with other Ministers and their departments.”198


“... wanted a step change in the work on delivery and reform, which I hope 
I managed to give him. Now ... how does the Cabinet Secretary work? You come 
in and you are – even with the two roles that you have, head of an organisation of 
half a million civil servants and in some sense co‑ordinating a public sector of about 
five million people. You have to make choices as to where you make your effort, and 
I think the policy I followed was not to take an issue over from someone to whom 
it was delegated simply because it was big and important, but you have to make a 
judgement as to whether it is being handled competently, whether that particular part 
is, in a sense, under pressure, whether you think they are getting it wrong in some 
sense, or they are missing certain important things.”199

departmental obligations nevertheless remains.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry434.  In the letter of 14 March 2003 from Lord Goldsmith’s office to No.10, which is 
addressed in Section 5 of the Report, Mr Blair was told that an essential ingredient of 
the legal basis was that he, himself, should be satisfied of the fact that Iraq was in breach 
of resolution 1441.

UK was concerned, Iraq was and remained in breach of resolution 1441. 

in terms that can only be described as perfunctory, no formal record was made of that 
decision and the precise grounds on which it was made remain unclear.

of peace and security in the Security Council. The UK Government was claiming 
to act on behalf of the international community “to uphold the authority of the Security 
Council”, knowing that it did not have a majority in the Security Council in support of 
its actions. In those circumstances, the UK’s actions undermined the authority of the 
Security Council.

the legal effect of resolution 1441. He concluded that the safer route would be to seek 
a second resolution, and he set out the ways in which, in the absence of a second 
resolution, the matter might be brought before a court. Lord Goldsmith identified a key 
question to be whether or not there was a need for an assessment of whether Iraq’s 
conduct constituted a failure to take the final opportunity or a failure fully to co‑operate 
within the meaning of operative paragraph 4, such that the basis of the cease‑fire 
was destroyed.

He judged a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 required a further Security 
Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678.

relation to Operation Desert Fox in Iraq in 1998 and Kosovo in 1999, UK forces had 
participated in military action on the basis of advice from previous Attorneys General 
that (paragraph 30) “the legality of the action under international law was no more than 
reasonably arguable”.


“... the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation to use 
force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds  
for concluding that Iraq failed to take the final opportunity. In other words, we  
would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non‑compliance and  
non‑co‑operation ... the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA will be highly significant 
in this respect.”


Executive Summary464.  Lord Goldsmith added:

“In the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC, you will need to consider extremely 
carefully whether the evidence of non‑co‑operation and non‑compliance by Iraq is 
sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final 
opportunity.”

The Attorney General understands that it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s 
view that Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] 
paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, but as this is a judgement for the Prime Minister, 
the Attorney would be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”


“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view that Iraq 
is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 of UNSCR 1441, because 
of ‘false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to

•  retained up to 360 tonnes of chemical agents and precursor chemicals and 
growth media which would allow it to produce more chemical and biological

a less serious proliferation threat than other key countries of concern – Iran, Libya and 
North Korea – which had current nuclear programmes. Iraq’s nuclear facilities had been

Planning for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq

The failure to plan or prepare for known risks
provided a clear indication of the potential scale of the post‑conflict task.


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry591.  It showed that, in order to achieve the UK’s desired end state, any post‑conflict 
administration would need to:

•  restore infrastructure that had deteriorated significantly in the decade since 
people;

•  administer a state where the upper echelons of a regime that had been in power 
since 1968 had been abruptly removed and in which the capabilities of the wider 
civil administration, many of whose employees were members of the ruling party, 
were difficult to assess; and

•  provide security in a country faced with a number of potential threats, including:

•  the need for an analysis of whether the benefits of military action outweighed the 
risk of a protracted and costly nation‑building exercise (including from Mr Straw 
on 8 July 2002: the US “must also understand that we are serious about our 
conditions for UK involvement”222);

•  the absence of credible US plans for the immediate post‑conflict period and 
the subsequent reconstruction of Iraq (including from the British Embassy 



Executive SummaryWashington after the Rock Drill on 21 and 22 February 2003: “The inter‑agency 
rehearsal for Phase IV … exposes the enormous scale of the task … Overall, 
planning is at a very rudimentary stage”223); 

•  the need to agree with the US the nature of the UK contribution to those plans 
(including in the letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Sir David Manning on 
leadership of the South‑East sector. The UK was “currently at risk of taking on 
a very substantial commitment that we will have great difficulty in sustaining

would be no legal cover for certain post‑conflict tasks;

{{ a UN framework for the administration and reconstruction of Iraq during the 

transition to Iraqi self‑government.

– the Coalition must prevent anarchy and internecine fighting breaking out”.226 

Mr Blair emphasised the importance of the post‑conflict phase:

“You do not engage in military conflict that may produce regime change unless you 
are prepared to follow through and work in the aftermath of that regime change to 
ensure the country is stable and the people are properly looked after.”227

post‑conflict plans.228

Commons on 18 March 2003, no assessment had been made of whether that vision 
was achievable, no agreement had been reached with the US on a workable post‑conflict 
plan, UN authorisation had not yet been secured, and there had been no decision on 
the UN’s role in post‑conflict Iraq. 



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry631.  UK policy rested on the assumption that:

in Iraq;

•  the US would provide effective leadership of the immediate post‑conflict effort 
•  the conditions would soon be in place for UK military withdrawal; 
•  after a short period of US‑led, UN‑authorised military occupation, the UN would 
administer and provide a framework for the reconstruction of post‑conflict Iraq; 
•  substantial international support would follow UN authorisation; and
•  reconstruction and the political transition to Iraqi rule would proceed in a secure 

environment. 


•  UK officials assessed that the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian 
Assistance (ORHA), the US body that would assume responsibility for the 
immediate post‑invasion administration of Iraq, was not up to the task.
•  Significant differences remained between UK and US positions on UN 
•  International partners were scarce and thought to be unlikely to come forward 
•  UK officials recognised that occupying forces would not remain welcome for long

UK military plan;

•  convened a Ministerial meeting on post‑conflict issues on 6 March 2003;
•  raised concerns about the state of planning with President Bush; and
•  succeeded in the narrow goal of securing President Bush’s agreement that 
the UN should be “heavily involved” in “the post‑conflict situation”, a loose 
formulation that appeared to bridge the gap between US and UK positions 
on UN authorisation and the post‑conflict role of the UN, but did not address 
the substantive issues.


Executive Summary634.  Mr Blair did not:

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry639.  Before the invasion, the JIC and the DIS had each identified that there was a risk 
of lawlessness breaking out in Iraq, and that it would be important to deal with it swiftly.

LOOTING IN BAGHDAD 
and without a clear Coalition Phase IV plan, looting and score‑settling became a 
serious problem in Baghdad soon after the regime fell. The looting of ministry buildings 
and damage to state‑owned infrastructure in particular added to the challenges 
of the Occupation. 

Representative on Iraq from March to June 2004, judged that the failure to crack down 
on looting in Baghdad in April 2003 released “a crime wave which the Coalition has 
never been able to bring fully under control”.233

“A security vacuum still exists [in Baghdad] ... particularly at night. Looting,

would be “tied down” outside the UK’s Area of Responsibility, with adverse impact, and

conclude that the tasks it was proposed that 16 Air Assault Brigade should undertake 
were unnecessary, but rather that US troops would complete them.

UK INFLUENCE ON POST‑INVASION STRATEGY: RESOLUTION 1483
Manning, two of Mr Blair’s closest advisers, offered him advice on how to influence the 
post‑invasion US agenda. Key among their concerns was the need for post‑conflict 
administrative arrangements to have the legitimacy conferred by UN endorsement. Such 
UK plans for the post‑conflict period as had been developed relied on the deployment of 
an international reconstruction effort to Iraq. Controversy surrounding the launch of the 
invasion made that challenging to deliver; the absence of UN endorsement would make 
it close to impossible.

UN or World Bank, in line with the pre‑invasion promise to use them exclusively for the 
benefit of Iraq. Instead, resolution 1483 placed the power to spend the Development 
Fund for Iraq into the hands of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), overseen by a 
monitoring board. That was in line with US objectives, but did not address UK concerns. 

and not be subordinate to the CPA. Resolution 1483 said that the CPA would retain 
its responsibilities until an internationally recognised representative government was 
established. The text did not go so far as to require an interim administration to report 
formally to the CPA, as the US wished, but that was in effect how the relationship 
between the CPA and the Governing Council established by resolution 1483 operated. 

Interim Iraqi Administration. Resolution 1483 gave the UN a role working with the people 
of Iraq and the CPA, but did not give it the lead. Evidence considered by the Inquiry 
suggests that there was consistent reluctance on the part of the UN to take on such a 
role and the UK position was therefore not wholly realistic. 

in Iraq. It also set the conditions for the CPA’s dominance over post‑invasion strategy 
and policy by handing it control of funding for reconstruction and influence on political 
development at least equal to that of the UN.

smaller than that of the US and was particularly concerned with Basra. 

rather than accept a national lead for a particular element of the Coalition effort (such 
as police reform). However, it was inevitable that Iraq’s future would be determined 
in Baghdad, as both the administrative centre and the place where the power shift 
from minority Sunni rule to majority Shia rule was going to be most keenly felt. Having 
decided to concentrate its effort on an area some distance removed from the capital, 
the UK’s ability to influence policy under debate in Baghdad was curtailed.

reasonable concerns about the personal legal liabilities of UK staff working initially 
in ORHA and then in the CPA, and what their deployment might imply about the UK’s 
responsibility for decisions made by those organisations, in the absence of formal 
consultation or the right of veto.

Such arrangements would have provided a means to identify and resolve different

This created a risk described to the Inquiry by Sir Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser 
from 2001 to 2006, as “the UK being held jointly responsible for acts or omissions 
of the CPA, without a right to consult and a right of joint decision”.235 



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry670.  To manage that risk, the UK proposed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the US to establish procedures for working together on issues related to the 
Occupation, but it could not be agreed. Having supplied the overwhelming majority of the 
CPA’s resources, the US had little incentive to give the UK an influential role in deciding 
how those resources were to be used, and the UK lacked the will and leverage to insist.

Ministers and officials in 2003, but the issue was never resolved.

number of military and other security entities that had operated as part of 
Saddam Hussein’s regime, including the armed forces (see Section 12). This 
was raised informally by Ambassador Bremer in his first meeting with Mr John 
Sawers, Mr Blair’s Special Representative on Iraq, who – unbriefed – did not at 
that point take a contrary position. The concept of creating a new army had also 
been raised by Mr Walt Slocombe, CPA Senior Adviser on National Security and 
Defense, in discussion with Mr Hoon. Dissolution was a key decision which was 
to have a significant effect on the alienation of the Sunni community and the 
development of an insurgency in Iraq, and the terms and timing of this important 
Order should have been approved by both Washington and London.


Executive Summary•  Decisions on how to spend the Development Fund for Iraq, which resolution 
vested Ambassador Bremer with control of the Fund, effectively placing it 
under US control. This exacerbated concerns about the under‑resourcing 
of CPA(South) as expressed in Mr Straw’s letter to Mr Blair of 5 June 2003 
(see Section 10.1). 

•  The creation of the Iraqi Central Bank as an independent body in July 2003 
(see Sections 9.2 and 10.1). This came as a surprise to the UK despite the 
close involvement of officials from the Treasury in arrangements for Iraq’s 
new currency and budget. 

•  The creation of a new Iraqi Central Criminal Court (see Section 9.2), the 
announcement of which UK officials could not delay for long enough to 
enable the Attorney General to give his view on its legality under the terms 
of resolution 1483. 

•  Production of the CPA’s ‘Vision for Iraq’ and ‘Achieving the Vision’ (see 

Sections 9.2 and 10.1). Mr Sawers alerted the FCO to the first document on 
had been signed off by the Pentagon. No formal UK approval was sought for 
a document which was intended to provide strategic direction to the Coalition’s 
non‑military effort in Iraq. 

de‑Ba’athification policy is considered in Section 11.2.

Mr Sawers or his successor Sir Jeremy Greenstock exerted on senior US officials. Both 
used their diplomatic experience to build connections with Iraqi politicians and contribute 
to the political development of Iraq. Instances of UK influence included:

•  Mr Sawers’ involvement in the plans for an Interim Iraqi Administration, 
in respect of which he considered that “much of the thinking is ours”.236 
•  Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s “two chickens, two eggs” plan, which overcame political 
stalemate between the CPA and Grand Ayatollah al‑Sistani on how the new Iraqi 
Constitution should be created. The plan led to the 15 November Agreement 
which set the timetable for transfer of sovereignty to a transitional administration 
by 30 June 2004. 

•  Ensuring that negotiations on the content of the Transitional Administrative Law 

reached a successful conclusion. Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that 
he had prevented the Kurdish delegation from leaving, “which Bremer wasn’t 
aware of”.237

A DECLINE IN SECURITY

organised opposition to the Coalition may be emerging”238 as discontent about the 
Coalition’s failure to deliver a secure environment began to grow in the Iraqi population. 

in Multi‑National Division (South‑East) (MND(SE)). Food shortages and the failure 
of essential services such as the supply of electricity and water, plus lack of progress 
in the political process, however, began to erode the relationship between UK forces 
and the local population. The deterioration was exemplified by attacks on UK forces 
in Majar al‑Kabir in Maysan province on 22 and 24 June. 

to identify issues with the potential to escalate into conflict and to recognise the likelihood 
that extremist groups would become more co‑ordinated. The constraint imposed on 
reconstruction activities by the lack of security began to be apparent. Mr Sawers and 
Sir David Manning expressed concern about whether the UK had sufficient troops 
deployed in MND(SE), and about the permeability of Maysan’s substantial border 
with Iran.

by Mr Blair with President Bush.

reconstruction activity. Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff 
(Commitments), reported “a decline in Iraqi consent to the Coalition in MND(SE) due to 
the failure by the Coalition to deliver improvements in essential services” and that Shia 
leaders were warning of a short grace period before further significant deterioration. 

becoming more sophisticated. Attacks on the UN in August and September, which 
injured and killed a number of UN officials including the UN Special Representative for 
Iraq, prompted some organisations to withdraw their international staff. Although Basra 
was less turbulent than the capital, the risk of a ripple effect from Baghdad – as identified 
by Gen Jackson in May – remained.

Coalition in MND(SE), and Islamic “extremists/terrorists”239 were expected to remain 
a long‑term threat in Iraq. The UK’s military and civilian representatives on the ground 
were reporting a growing insurgency in central Iraq.

in Basra would remain relatively benign.

of a deteriorating security situation should have led him to conclude that the underlying 
assumptions on which the UK’s Iraq campaign was based was over‑optimistic, and 
to instigate a review of the scale of the UK’s military effort in Iraq.

•  whether the UK had sufficient resources in MND(SE) to deal with a worsening 
•  whether the UK should engage outside MND(SE) in the interests of Iraq’s 

security situation; and

overall stability (as had been advocated by Gen Jackson, Maj Gen Richards 
and Lt Gen Pigott).




The Report of the Iraq Inquiry692.  There was a strong case for reinforcing MND(SE) so that it could handle its 
high‑priority tasks (providing essential security for reconstruction projects, protecting 
existing infrastructure, guarding key sites and improving border security to inhibit 
the import of arms from Iran) effectively in changing circumstances. Those tasks all 
demanded a higher level of manpower than was available. Although additional military 
personnel were deployed in September 2003, mainly to fill existing gaps in support for 
reconstruction activities, their numbers were far too small to have a significant impact. 

omission and Lt Gen Reith and Gen Walker should have ensured that UK force levels in 
MND(SE) were formally reconsidered in autumn 2003 or at the latest by the end of the 
year. Increases in UK force levels in order to address the security situation should have 
been recommended to Ministers. Any opportunity to regain the initiative and pre‑empt 
further deterioration in the security situation was lost.

Sanchez, Commander Combined Joint Task Force‑7, had “come to recognise that 
Coalition operations are at a standstill and that there is a need to regain momentum”.240 
Doubts started to build about the chances of credible elections based on a legitimate 
constitution in the course of 2004 and work began to look for alternatives to the plan set 
out by Ambassador Bremer. The “bloodiest 48‑hour period in Baghdad since March”,241 
including an attack on the al‑Rashid Hotel in Baghdad’s Green Zone, was sufficient 
to convince some that a pivotal point in the security situation had been reached.

Lt Gen Fry argued that a strategy of “early effect”242 was needed which prioritised

require the withdrawal of resources from other operations.

Executive Summary698.  Despite mounting evidence of violent insurgency, the UK’s policy of military 
drawdown in Iraq continued. After force levels had been reviewed in January, the 
rationale for continued drawdown was based on adjusted criteria by which the success 
of Security Sector Reform would be judged, meaning that such reform would be 
implemented “only to applicable standards for Iraq”.244

Having recognised that a stable and secure environment was the key factor on which 
progress in Iraq depended, by May 2004 the UK solution was “a better and quicker 
plan for building Iraqi capacity in the Police, Civil Defence Corps, the Army and the 
Intelligence Service”.247 This made sense in the long term but was unlikely to meet

(Senior British Military Representative – Iraq) judged that the Iraqi Security Forces would 
not be able to take full responsibility for security before 2006.



Executive Summary712.  In September 2004, Gen Walker received a well‑argued piece of advice from 
Lt Gen McColl which made clear that the conditions on which decisions on drawdown 
were to be based were unlikely to be met in the near future. Despite the warnings in 
Lt Gen McColl’s paper and his advice that “the time is right for the consideration of the 
substantive issues”,248 the Chiefs of Staff, chaired by Gen Walker, declined to engage 
in a substantive review of UK options.

It is possible that the UK may not have been able to make a real difference, when the 
key strategic change that might have affected the outcome was the deployment of a 
much larger force. But proper consideration ought to have been given to what options 
were available, including for the deployment of additional personnel. Mr Straw raised 
the need for such a debate with Mr Blair in October.

State Criteria (SSC) before the UN mandate expires, or even shortly thereafter”.250 He 
judged that “only additional military effort by the MNF‑I [Multi‑National Force – Iraq] as 
a whole” might be able to get the campaign back on track. Lt Gen Fry identified three 
possible courses of action for the UK: increasing the UK scale of effort, maintaining the 
status quo or, if it were judged that the campaign was irretrievable, accepting failure and

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry718.  On 30 January, elections for the Transitional National Assembly and Provincial 
Assemblies took place across Iraq. Security arrangements involved 130,000 personnel 
from the Iraqi Security Forces, supported by 184,500 troops from the MNF‑I. The JIC 
assessed that perhaps fewer than 10 percent of voters had turned out in the Sunni 
heartlands and judged that “without Sunni engagement in the political process, it will not 
be possible significantly to undermine the insurgency”.

enduring medium scale military operations at the same time:

“Since the SDR we have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either 
a single major operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the 
Gulf War in 1990‑91), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a 
lesser scale (as in the mid‑1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a 
second substantial deployment ... if this were made necessary by a second crisis. 
We would not, however, expect both deployments to involve war‑fighting or to 
maintain them simultaneously for longer than six months.”252

operating at or above the level of concurrency defined in the 1998 SDR, and the 
continuation of Op TELIC had placed additional strain on military personnel. 



Executive Summary725.  By May 2005, the UK had been supporting an operation of at least medium scale 
in Iraq for more than two years. The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas 
Policy Sub‑Committee on Iraq (DOP(I)) recognised that future force levels in Iraq would 
need to be considered in the context of the requirement to achieve “strategic balance” 
with commitments in Afghanistan, to ensure that both were properly resourced.

on high‑risk assumptions about the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the 
lead for security. If those assumptions proved to be inaccurate and the UK was unable to 
withdraw, agreement to the Helmand deployment in Afghanistan effectively constrained 
the UK’s ability to respond by increasing troop levels in Iraq.

southern Afghanistan” which included a Provincial Reconstruction Team as “part of 
a larger, more than 3,300‑strong British force providing the security framework”.253

Although Iraq remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the

resources to Iraq, the UK was consequently unable to contemplate a parallel surge

of reducing UK troop levels based on the transition of lead responsibility for security 
to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). In one of his early acts as Defence Secretary, he 
announced the deployment of just over 400 additional personnel to enhance the UK’s 
effort in training the ISF, which would “enable them to take on ever greater responsibility 
for their own security and so pave the way for UK troops to withdraw”.255

in July 2005 suggested transition from MNF‑I to ISF primacy in Basra from March 2006, 
based on the assumption that the ISF would, by that point, be capable of taking on 
responsibility for security in what was likely to remain a very challenging environment.

the ISF would be ready to take the lead in Basra by that point was probably unrealistic.

concerns that had been expressed about the capacity of the ISF, Dr Reid recommended 
that a reduction in UK forces should take place in October or November 2005. 

(see Section 12.1) raised questions about the ISF in MND(SE). Officials from the FCO, 
the MOD and DFID judged that the incident had highlighted the risks to achieving UK 
objectives in MND(SE), and that those risks had implications for military resources. 
Nevertheless, assumptions about ISF readiness were not re‑examined by Ministers. 
The incident should have prompted a more searching analysis of whether the conditions 
necessary for drawdown were likely to be met within the planned timetable. Reluctance 
to consider the potential implications of the Jameat incident obscured what it had 
revealed about the security situation in MND(SE).

Provincial Iraqi Control, on which UK plans to draw down were based, was emphasised 
by the ‘Conditions for Provincial Transfer’ published by the Joint Iraqi/MNF Committee 
to Transfer Security Responsibility, and by Dr Reid, who told DOP(I) that “successful 
Iraqiisation remains the key”.256 DOP(I) decided that Dr Reid should have lead 
responsibility for building the capacity of the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) in Basra in 
addition to his responsibility for the Iraqi Army.

ISF effectiveness in a minute to Gen Walker, and concluded: “it is not to our credit that

and coalition strategy in Iraq. They concluded that “Ministers needed to be clear 
that the campaign could potentially be heading for ‘strategic failure’, with grave 
national and international consequences if the appropriate actions were not taken”.258 
Gen Walker judged that only 5 percent of UK military effort in MND(SE) was devoted 
to counter‑insurgency operations. But neither Air Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, Commander 
Joint Operations, nor Gen Walker reassessed UK force requirements in Iraq, based 
on those two assessments.

responsibility for tactical decision‑making rested with commanders on the ground, it was

to deliver the conditions required for transfer. At the end of 2005 and in early 2006 
there were further indications that the ISF were not ready to operate alone. The MOD 
reported to the final DOP(I) meeting of 2005 that the capacity of the Iraqi administration 
and security forces to assume responsibility, acknowledging the challenge of increasing 
sectarianism and militia infiltration, was one of the key challenges remaining.

“completion of various security sector reform tasks, a reduction in the support levels for 
those tasks, and recent efficiency measures in theatre”.259 That rationale did not include 
an assessment of the effect of those tasks on the capability of the ISF.

A MAJOR DIVERGENCE IN STRATEGY
decision to focus its attention on MND(SE) in 2003. As a result of that decision, the UK 
had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US. It was only marginally involved in 
the central tasks of stabilising the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and managing sectarian 
divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation 
calm while building the case for drawdown. 

UK regarding assessments of progress, and differing assumptions about whether 
plans were needed for long‑term bases in Iraq. In May 2006, Mr Blair was told about 
“rumblings from the US system about UK failure to grip the security situation in what they 
regard as a strategically vital part of Iraq”.260 Gen Jackson felt compelled to report that:

“The perception, right or wrong, in some – if not all – US military circles is that the 
UK is motivated more by the short‑term political gain of early withdrawal than by the 
long‑term importance of mission accomplishment; and that, as a result, MND(SE)’s 
operational posture is too laissez faire and lacks initiative ...”261

sharp relief by President Bush’s announcement that the US would adopt a new strategy, 
of which a prominent feature would be the deployment of a surge of US forces, primarily 
to Baghdad and its environs. UK assessments of the prospects for the new US policy 
were bleak, reflecting widespread pessimism about the prospects for Iraq. UK strategy 
continued to look towards withdrawal.

Executive SummaryA POSSIBLE CIVIL WAR
of civil war in Iraq, prompted by rising levels of sectarian violence and concerns that the 
Iraqi Government was “not ... perceived as even‑handed in security issues”.263 The risk 
of civil war had been acknowledged by Prime Minister Ibrahim Ja’afari in the wake of the 
bombing of the al‑Askari mosque in February. Although there was general agreement 
that the situation in Iraq did not constitute civil war, the risk that one might develop was 
considered to be real.

Security Council which accompanied the resolution clearly identified providing security

was bleak. He judged that “what we will leave behind will not look much like strategic 
success. Ten years hence our strategy may fully bear fruit.”265

Defence Staff, advised Dr Reid that there should be no change to the operational 
approach and that there were “compelling reasons” why the UK should “press on” 
with handing over security to Iraq, including to permit the UK’s continuing build‑up in 
Afghanistan.266 ACM Stirrup identified the risk that UK withdrawal from Basra would be 
seen as a “strategic failure” and suggested that “astute conditioning of the UK public 
may be necessary” to avoid that.

security challenges in Basra was not consistent with Government policy that withdrawal 
should be conditions‑based. 



The Report of the Iraq Inquiry759.  ACM Stirrup’s acceptance that the “law of diminishing returns” was “now firmly 
in play” and that there was “an increasing risk” that UK forces would “become part of 
the problem, rather than the solution” had some validity: it was clear from accounts 
of the situation in Basra that UK forces were not preventing a steady decline in 
security. ACM Stirrup was also right to advise Dr Reid that the MNF in Iraq faced a 
“multifaceted”, sophisticated and dangerous enemy; that serious issues remained 
in Basra (militia activity, poor governance, insecurity); and that it was possible the 
UK would be accused of strategic failure.

ACM Stirrup’s proposed remedy of continued drawdown and managing public opinion 
did not mitigate the risk of strategic failure he described.

improve Basra through operations, high impact reconstruction and SSR [Security Sector 
Reform] ... lasting for up to six months”.267 The military element of the plan became 
known as Operation SALAMANCA and included operations against militia groups. 

for Op SALAMANCA and the possibility of deploying UK forces to support US operations 
outside MND(SE).

if Op SALAMANCA was to be a success, Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, 
the Senior British Military Representative – Iraq, indicated a concern that even with 
US support the capabilities available in MND(SE) might not be sufficient successfully 
to deliver Op SALAMANCA.

were to be met by existing MND(SE) personnel (including contractors) and any shortfalls 
were to be identified and considered appropriately. 

Division (Centre South): 

“... crossed a clear policy ‘red line’ and seemed counter‑intuitive, given that 
consideration was also being given to obtaining US forces for MND(SE). The UK 
needed to draw down its force levels as soon as practicable, both in MND(SE) 
and elsewhere.”268



Executive Summary766.  The decision not to allow the use of US support in Basra was an important one. 
The Inquiry considers that the question of what was needed to make Op SALAMANCA 
a success should have been addressed directly by ACM Stirrup, whose response 
instead precluded proper consideration of whether additional UK resources would be 
required. 

operate outside MND(SE) and there may have been concern that US participation in 
Op SALAMANCA would have led to an obligation on the UK to engage more outside 
MND(SE). This might not, as ACM Stirrup observed, be consistent with a commitment 
to drawdown, but might have reduced the risk of strategic failure. 

September 2006, so that the eventual operation (renamed Operation SINBAD) left 
“Basra in the hands of the militant militia and death squads, with the ISF unable to 
impose, let alone maintain, the rule of law”.269 This contributed to the conditions which 
led the UK into negotiations with JAM in early 2007. 

tactics to be used by US surge forces and the UK’s tactics for Op SINBAD, the UK 
operation did not deploy sufficient additional resources to conduct “Hold” and “Build” 
phases with anything like the same strategic effect. The additional 360 troops deployed 
by the UK could not have had the same effect as the more than 20,000 troops surged 
into Baghdad and its environs by the US. 

became explicit. In a report to Mr Blair, Major General Richard Shirreff, General 
Officer Commanding MND(SE), diagnosed that the existing arrangement, in which the 
Provincial Reconstruction Team was located in Kuwait, “lacks unity of command and 
unity of purpose”270 and proposed the establishment of a “Joint Inter‑Agency Task Force” 
in Basra led by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE). 

Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal. That may have been the right conclusion, but the 
effect was to deter consideration of a real problem and of ways in which military and 
civilian operations in MND(SE) could be better aligned.

drawdown of UK forces. But other contemporary evidence indicated a more negative 
picture of circumstances in Basra than ACM Stirrup’s view that:

problems and therefore they might wish to look to propose the south of the country 
as a model through which we can recommend a drawdown of forces.”274

mean moving to PIC in fact if not in name. Mr Brown, who had become Prime Minister 
in June, was keen that the gap between leaving the Palace and transfer to PIC should 
be as small as possible, since UK situational awareness and ability to conduct operations 
in Basra would be limited once the Palace was no longer in use.

not be possible to demonstrate readiness until after the transfer had taken place. 



Executive SummaryGeneral David Petraeus, Commanding General MNF‑I, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, 
US Ambassador to Iraq, remained “circumspect” on the timing of PIC.275 They considered 
that there remained “significant problems” associated with “unstable politics” and “JAM 
infiltration” in Basra. 

Jonathan Shaw, General Officer Commanding MND(SE) from January to August 2007, 
and Lieutenant General William Rollo, Senior British Military Representative – Iraq 
from July 2007 to March 2008, identified the impact of limited resources on the UK’s 
military effort and questioned the drive for continued drawdown in Iraq in order to 
prioritise resources for Helmand. Maj Gen Shaw wrote: “We have been hamstrung for 
resources throughout the tour, driven by the rising strategic significance of the Afghan 
deployment.”276

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry787.  ACM Stirrup’s conclusion that there was no need to review UK drawdown plans

Did the UK achieve its objectives in Iraq?
Ministers – began to consider whether the UK was heading towards “strategic failure” 
in Iraq. 


•  the development of a widespread sectarian conflict or civil war in Iraq;
•  “victory” for terrorist groups; 
•  collapse of the democratic process; 
•  failure to achieve the UK’s objectives; 
•  failure to achieve a stable and secure environment in Basra;
•  the collapse of the UK/Iraq relationship;
•  the division of Iraq and the end of its existence as a nation state;
•  damage to the UK’s military and political reputation; and
•  damage to the relationship between the US and UK.

conclusion that strategic failure was inevitable, although most recognised that without 
some form of corrective action it was a serious risk. 

substantial change in approach was ever implemented: UK troop numbers continued 
to reduce; the size of the civilian deployment varied very little; the Iraqiisation of security 
and handover of responsibility to the Iraqi Government remained key objectives. 

January 2003: it fell far short of strategic success. Although the borders of Iraq were the 
same as they had been in 2003, deep sectarian divisions threatened both stability and 
unity. Those divisions were not created by the coalition, but they were exacerbated by 
its decisions on de‑Ba’athification and on demobilisation of the Iraqi Army and were not 
addressed by an effective programme of reconciliation.

to be the greatest strategic threat to Iraq’s stability. 



Executive Summary794.  The fragility of the situation in Basra, which had been the focus of UK effort in 
MND(SE), was clear. The JIC assessed that threats remained from Iranian‑backed 
JAM Special Groups, and the Iraqi Security Forces remained reliant on support from 
Multi‑National Forces to address weaknesses in leadership and tactical support. Even 
as UK troops withdrew from Basra, the US was sufficiently concerned to deploy its own 
forces there, to secure the border and protect supply lines. 

Iraq’s communities were represented. But, as demonstrated by the protracted process 
of negotiating agreements on the status of US and then UK forces in Iraq, and the 
continued absence of a much‑needed Hydrocarbons Law, representation did not 
translate into effective government. In 2008, Transparency International judged Iraq to 
be the third most corrupt country in the world, and in mid‑2009 the Assessments Staff 
judged that Government ministries were “riddled with” corruption.279

objectives for Iraq were misjudged. No evidence had been identified that Iraq possessed 
weapons of mass destruction, with which it might threaten its neighbours and the 
international community more widely. But in the years between 2003 and 2009, events 
in Iraq had undermined regional stability, including by allowing Al Qaida space in which 
to operate and unsecured borders across which its members might move. 

the resources that the Government was prepared to commit to the task was substantial 
from the start. Even with more resources it would have been difficult to achieve those 
objectives, as a result of the circumstances of the invasion, the lack of international 
support, the inadequacy of planning and preparation, and the inability to deliver law and 
order. The lack of security hampered progress at every turn. It is therefore not surprising 
that, despite the considerable efforts made by UK civilian and military personnel over 
this period, the results were meagre. 

guaranteed greater success in the circumstances of March 2003. What can be said is 
that a number of opportunities for the sort of candid reappraisal of policies that would 
have better aligned objectives and resources did not take place. There was no serious 
consideration of more radical options, such as an early withdrawal or else a substantial 
increase in effort. The Inquiry has identified a number of moments, especially during the 
first year of the Occupation, when it would have been possible to conduct a substantial 
reappraisal. None took place.



The Report of the Iraq InquiryKey findings

Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002

•  After the attacks on the US on 9/11, Mr Blair declared that the UK would 

stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US to defeat and eradicate international 
terrorism. 

•  Mr Blair took an active and leading role throughout the autumn of 2001 in 
building a coalition to act against that threat, including taking military action 
against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

•  Mr Blair also emphasised the potential risk of terrorists acquiring and using 
•  In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair sought to influence US policy and prevent precipitate

military action by the US, which he considered would undermine the success 
of the coalition which had been established for action against international 
terrorism. He recommended identifying an alternative policy which would 
command widespread international support. 

•  In December 2001, Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq 

that would build over time, including “if necessary” taking military action without 
losing international support.

•  The tactics chosen by Mr Blair were to emphasise the threat which Iraq might 
pose, rather than a more balanced consideration of both Iraq’s capabilities and 
intent; and to offer the UK’s support for President Bush in an effort to influence 
his decisions on how to proceed.

•  That remained Mr Blair’s approach in the months that followed.

Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – 
“axis of evil” to Crawford

•  The UK continued to pursue implementation of the “smarter” economic sanctions 
regime in the first months of 2002, but continuing divisions between Permanent 
Members of the Security Council meant there was no agreement on the way 
forward.

•  In public statements at the end of February and in the first week of March 2002, 

Mr Blair and Mr Straw set out the view that Iraq was a threat which had to be 
dealt with. 

•  At Cabinet on 7 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that no decisions 
had been taken and Cabinet was not being asked to take decisions. Cabinet 
endorsed the conclusion that Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) 


Executive Summaryprogrammes posed a threat to peace and endorsed a strategy of engaging 
closely with the US Government in order to shape policy and its presentation. 
•  At Crawford, Mr Blair offered President Bush a partnership in dealing urgently 
with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. He proposed that the UK and US 
should pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the 
return of weapons inspectors or face the consequences. 

•  Following his meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein

invasion of Iraq was a profound change in UK thinking. Although no decisions had 
been taken, that became the basis for contingency planning in the months ahead.

Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002

•  By July 2002, the UK Government had concluded that President Bush 
was impatient to move on Iraq and that the US might take military action 
in circumstances that would be difficult for the UK. 

•  Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July sought to persuade President Bush 
to use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership with the US 
and setting out a framework for action.

•  Mr Blair told President Bush that the UN was the simplest way to encapsulate a 
“casus belli” in some defining way, with an ultimatum to Iraq once military forces 
started to build up in October. That might be backed by a UN resolution.

•  Mr Blair’s Note, which had not been discussed or agreed with his colleagues, 
set the UK on a path leading to diplomatic activity in the UN and the possibility 
of participation in military action in a way that would make it very difficult for the 
UK subsequently to withdraw its support for the US.

Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 

•  In discussions with the US over the summer of 2002, Mr Blair and Mr Straw 

sought to persuade the US Administration to secure multilateral support before 
taking action on Iraq; and to do so through the UN. They proposed a strategy 
in which the first objective was to offer Iraq the opportunity and last chance to 
comply with its obligations to disarm. 

•  If Iraq did not take that opportunity and military action was required, the UK was 
seeking to establish conditions whereby such action would command multilateral 
support and be taken with the authority of the Security Council.

•  Mr Blair also decided to publish an explanation of why action was needed 
•  The UK made a significant contribution to President Bush’s decision, announced 
•  Statements made by China, France and Russia after President Bush’s speech 
highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent Members of the Security 
Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding whether military 
action was justified. As a result, the negotiation of resolution 1441 was complex 
and difficult. 

Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 

•  The declared objective of the US and UK was to obtain international support 
within the framework of the UN for a strategy of coercive diplomacy for the 
disarmament of Iraq. For the UK, regime change was a means to achieve 
disarmament, not an objective in its own right. 

Security Council on the need to achieve the disarmament of Iraq. 

•  The negotiation of resolution 1441 reflected a broad consensus in the UN 
•  To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of 
the US and France and Russia, resolution 1441 was a compromise containing 
drafting ‘fixes’. 

•  That created deliberate ambiguities on a number of key issues including: the 
level of non‑compliance with resolution 1441 which would constitute a material 
breach; by whom that determination would be made; and whether there would 
be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use of force.

Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to 
January 2003

•  Following the adoption of resolution 1441, the UK was pursuing a strategy of 
coercive diplomacy to secure the disarmament of Iraq. The hope was that this 
might be achieved by peaceful means, but views differed on how likely that 
would be.

•  The UK Government remained convinced that Iraq had retained prohibited 

weapons and was pursuing chemical, biological and ballistic missile 
programmes in contravention of its obligations to disarm; and that the absence 
of evidence of weapons and programmes was the result of a successful policy 
of concealment.


Executive Summary•  By early January 2003, Mr Blair had concluded that Iraq had had “no change of 
heart” and military action to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime was likely to be 
required to disarm Iraq.

•  The US Administration was planning military action no later than early March. 
•  Mr Blair and Mr Straw concluded that a second UN resolution would be essential 
to secure domestic and international support for military action. In the absence 
of a “smoking gun”, that would require more time and a series of reports from 
the UN inspectors which established a pattern of Iraqi non‑compliance with 
its obligations.

•  Mr Blair secured President Bush’s support for a second resolution but did not 
secure agreement that the inspections process should continue until the end 
of March or early April. That left little time for the inspections process to provide 
the evidence that would be needed to achieve international agreement on the 
way ahead. 

Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

•  By the time the Security Council met on 7 March 2003 there were deep divisions 
•  Following President Bush’s agreement to support a second resolution to help 

within it on the way ahead on Iraq. 

Mr Blair, Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued during February and early March 2003 
to develop the position that Saddam Hussein was not co‑operating as required 
by resolution 1441 (2002) and, if that situation continued, a second resolution 
should be adopted stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered 
by the Security Council.

•  On 6 February, Mr Blair said that the UK would consider military action without 
a further resolution only if the inspectors reported that they could not do their 
job and a resolution was vetoed unreasonably. The UK would not take military 
action without a majority in the Security Council.

•  Mr Blair’s proposals, on 19 February, for a side statement defining tough tests 
for Iraq’s co‑operation and a deadline of 14 March for a vote by the Security 
Council, were not agreed by the US. 

•  The initial draft of a US, UK and Spanish resolution tabled on 24 February, which 
simply invited the Security Council to decide that Iraq had failed to take the final 
opportunity offered by resolution 1441, failed to attract support.

•  Throughout February, the divisions in the Security Council widened.
•  France, Germany and Russia set out their common position on 10 and 

continued and reinforced inspections with a clear timeline and a military build‑up 
to exert maximum pressure on Iraq to disarm.


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry•  The reports to the Security Council by the IAEA reported increasing indications 

of Iraqi co‑operation. On 7 March, Dr ElBaradei reported that there was no 
indication that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities and that it should be able 
to provide the Security Council with an assessment of Iraq’s activities in the 
near future.

•  Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on 7 March that there had been an 

acceleration of initiatives from Iraq and, while they did not constitute immediate 
co‑operation, they were welcome. UNMOVIC would be proposing a work 
programme for the Security Council’s approval, based on key tasks for Iraq to 
address. It would take months to verify sites and items, analyse documents, 
interview relevant personnel and draw conclusions.

•  A revised draft US, UK and Spanish resolution, tabled after the reports by Dr Blix 

and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March and proposing a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to 
demonstrate full co‑operation, also failed to attract support. 

•  China, France and Russia all stated that they did not favour a resolution 

authorising the use of force and that the Security Council should maintain its 
efforts to find a peaceful solution.

•  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that a “side statement” with defined benchmarks 
for Iraqi co‑operation could be needed to secure support from Mexico and Chile.
•  Mr Blair told President Bush that he would need a majority of nine votes in the 

Security Council for Parliamentary approval for UK military action.

Iraq WMD assessments, pre‑July 2002

•  The ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and 
biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible 
enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear 
capability, and was pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment, had 
underpinned the UK Government’s policy towards Iraq since the Gulf Conflict 
ended in 1991.

•  Iraq’s chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a 
threat to international peace and security in the Middle East, but overall, the 
threat from Iraq was viewed as less serious than that from other key countries 
of concern – Iran, Libya and North Korea. 

•  The Assessments issued by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) reflected the 
uncertainties within the intelligence community about the detail of Iraq’s activities.
•  The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public from 
late 2001 onwards conveyed more certainty than the JIC Assessments about 
Iraq’s proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed.


Executive Summary•  The tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraq’s “weapons of mass 

destruction” was likely to have created the impression that Iraq posed a greater 
threat than the detailed JIC Assessments would have supported. 

•  There was nothing in the JIC Assessments issued before July 2002 that would 
have raised any questions in policy‑makers’ minds about the core construct of 
Iraq’s capabilities and intent. Indeed, from May 2001 onwards, the perception 
conveyed was that Iraqi activity could have increased since the departure of the 
weapons inspectors, funded by Iraq’s growing illicit income from circumventing 
the sanctions regime.

•  In the light of sensitivities about their content and significance, publication of 
documents on ‘Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction’, ‘Weapons Inspections’ 
and ‘Abuse of Human Rights’ was postponed until the policy on Iraq was clearer.

Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

•  The urgency and certainty with which the Government stated that Iraq was 
a threat which had to be dealt with fuelled the demand for publication of the 
dossier and led to Mr Blair’s decision to publish it in September, separate from 
any decision on the way ahead.

•  The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary and 
public support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required 
to secure Iraq’s disarmament.

•  The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is no 
evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 
improperly influenced the text. 

•  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt either that 

Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons 
or that efforts to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC should have 
made that clear to Mr Blair.

•  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September 2002, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s 
past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the 
potential threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction; and that at some point 
in the future that threat would become a reality.

•  The dossier’s description of Iraq’s capabilities and intent became part of the 

baseline against which the UK Government measured Iraq’s future statements 
and actions and the success of weapons inspections.

•  The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the 
firmness of the evidence has produced a damaging legacy which may make it 
more difficult to secure support for Government policy, including military action, 
where the evidence depends on inferential judgements drawn from intelligence.


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry•  There are lessons which should be implemented in using information from 

JIC Assessments to underpin policy decisions.

Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003

•  The ingrained belief already described in this Section underpinned the UK 
Government’s position that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with and it 
needed to disarm or be disarmed. That remained the case up to and beyond 
the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003.

biological or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either 
the JIC or the policy community.

•  A formal reassessment of the JIC’s judgements should have taken place after 

Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 14 February 2003 or, at the very latest, 
after his report of 7 March.

•  Intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq’s capabilities and 

intent continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government 
statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the 
limitations of the intelligence.

•  The independence and impartiality of the JIC remains of the utmost importance.
•  SIS had a responsibility to ensure that key recipients of its reporting were 
informed in a timely way when doubts arose about key sources and when, 
subsequently, intelligence was withdrawn. 

The search for WMD

•  The search for evidence of WMD in Iraq was started during the military 
campaign by Exploitation Task Force‑75 and was carried forward from 
June 2003 by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG). The UK participated in both.


Executive Summary•  As the insurgency developed, the ISG’s operating conditions became 

increasingly difficult. There was competition for resources between 
counter‑terrorism operations and the search for WMD evidence, and 
some ISG staff were diverted to the former.

•  Mr Blair took a close interest in the work of the ISG and the presentation 
of its reports and the wider narrative about WMD. He raised the subject 
with President Bush. 

•  The Government was confident that pre‑conflict assessments of Iraq’s WMD 
capabilities would be confirmed once Saddam Hussein’s regime had been 
removed.

•  It quickly became apparent that it was unlikely that significant stockpiles would 
be found. This led to challenges to the credibility of both the Government and 
the intelligence community.

•  There were soon demands for an independent judge‑led inquiry into the

an independent inquiry in favour of reviews initiated by the House of Commons 
Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee of 
Parliament. 

•  The Government’s reluctance to establish an independent public inquiry became 

untenable in January 2004 when President Bush announced his own decision 
to set up an independent inquiry in the US.

•  Faced with criticism of the pre‑conflict intelligence and the absence of evidence 
of a current Iraqi WMD capability, Mr Blair sought to defend the decision to take 
military action by emphasising instead:

{{ Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent;
{{ the regime’s breaches of Security Council resolutions; and 
{{ the positive impact of military action in Iraq on global counter‑proliferation 

efforts. 

•  The ISG’s principal findings – that Iraq’s WMD capability had mostly been 
destroyed in 1991 but that it had been Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent 
to preserve the capability to reconstitute his WMD – were significant, but 
did not support statements made by the UK and US Governments before the 
invasion, which had focused on Iraq’s current capabilities and an urgent and 
growing threat.

•  The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 drew 

on the ISG’s findings, but was not the explanation given before the conflict. 


The Report of the Iraq InquiryAdvice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to 
March 2003

•  On 9 December, formal ‘instructions’ to provide advice were sent to Lord 

Goldsmith. They were sent by the FCO on behalf of the FCO and the MOD as 
well as No.10. The instructions made it clear that Lord Goldsmith should not 
provide an immediate response. 

•  Until 27 February, No.10 could not have been sure that Lord Goldsmith would 

advise that there was a basis on which military action against Iraq could be 
taken in the absence of a further decision of the Security Council. 

•  Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice of 7 March set out alternative interpretations 
of the legal effect of resolution 1441. While Lord Goldsmith remained “of the 
opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure a second resolution”, he 
concluded (paragraph 28) that “a reasonable case can be made that resolution 
resolution”.

•  Lord Goldsmith wrote that a reasonable case did not mean that if the matter 
ever came to court, he would be confident that the court would agree with this 
view. He judged a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 required a further 
Security Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678.
•  At a meeting on 11 March, there was concern that the advice did not offer a 

clear indication that military action would be lawful. Lord Goldsmith was asked, 
after the meeting, by Admiral Boyce on behalf of the Armed Forces, and by the 
Treasury Solicitor, Ms Juliet Wheldon, in respect of the Civil Service, to give a 
clear‑cut answer on whether military action would be lawful rather than unlawful.
•  Lord Goldsmith concluded on 13 March that, on balance, the “better view” was 

that the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this 
case, meaning that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further 
resolution beyond resolution 1441.

•  Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on 14 March:

“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further 
resolution of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has 
failed to comply with and co‑operate fully in the implementation of resolution 
Council in that resolution. The Attorney General understands that it is 
unequivocally the Prime Minister’s view that Iraq has committed further 
material breaches as specified in [operative] paragraph 4 of resolution 
be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”


Executive Summary•  Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on 15 March:

“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view 
that Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 [operative 
paragraph 4] of UNSCR 1441, because of ‘false statements or omissions in 
the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure to 
comply with, and co‑operate fully in the interpretation of, this resolution’.”

•  Senior Ministers should have considered the question posed in Mr Brummell’s 
letter of 14 March, either in the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee or a 
“War Cabinet”, on the basis of formal advice. Such a Committee should then 
have reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its Members were asked to 
endorse the Government’s policy.

•  Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to 
•  That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position – 
it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take 
“the final opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by 
resolution 1441. 

•  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as the advice 
of 7 March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding the legal effect of 
resolution 1441 and whether, in particular, it authorised military action without 
a further resolution of the Security Council. 

•  The advice should have been provided to Ministers and senior officials whose 
responsibilities were directly engaged and should have been made available 
to Cabinet. 

Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq

•  The size and composition of a UK military contribution to the US‑led invasion of 
Iraq was largely discretionary. The US wanted some UK capabilities (including 
Special Forces), to use UK bases, and the involvement of the UK military to 
avoid the perception of unilateral US military action. The primary impetus to 
maximise the size of the UK contribution and the recommendations on its 
composition came from the Armed Forces, with the agreement of Mr Hoon.

•  From late February 2002, the UK judged that Saddam Hussein’s regime could

operation, the UK should contribute a division comprising three brigades. That 
was perceived to be commensurate with the UK’s capabilities and the demands 
of the campaign. Anything smaller risked being compared adversely to the UK’s 
contribution to the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.

in southern Iraq. 

Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003

•  The decisions taken between mid‑December 2002 and mid‑January 2003 to 
increase the combat force deployed to three brigades and bring forward the 
date on which UK forces might participate in combat operations compressed 
the timescales available for preparation.


Executive Summary•  The decision to deploy a large scale force for potential combat operations 
was taken without collective Ministerial consideration of the decision and 
its implications.

•  The large scale force deployed was a one‑shot capability. It would have been 

difficult to sustain the force if combat operations had been delayed until autumn

Military equipment (pre‑conflict)

•  The decisions taken between mid‑December 2002 and mid‑January 2003 
to increase combat forces and bring forward the date on which UK forces 
might participate in combat operations compressed the timescales available 
for preparation.

•  The achievements made in preparing the forces in the time available were very 
considerable, but the deployment of forces more quickly than anticipated in the 
Defence Planning Assumptions meant that there were some serious equipment 
shortfalls when conflict began.

•  Those shortfalls were exacerbated by the lack of an effective asset tracking 
system, a lesson from previous operations and exercises that the MOD had 
identified but not adequately addressed.

•  Ministers were not fully aware of the risks inherent in the decisions and the MOD 
and PJHQ were not fully aware of the situation on the ground during the conflict.

Planning for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq
Sections 6.4 and 6.5:

•  Before the invasion of Iraq, Ministers, senior officials and the UK military 
recognised that post‑conflict civilian and military operations were likely to 
be the strategically decisive phase of the Coalition’s engagement in Iraq.

•  UK planning and preparation for the post‑conflict phase of operations, which 

rested on the assumption that the UK would be able quickly to reduce its military 
presence in Iraq and deploy only a minimal number of civilians, were wholly 
inadequate.

•  The information available to the Government before the invasion provided a 

clear indication of the potential scale of the post‑conflict task and the significant 
risks associated with the UK’s proposed approach.

•  Foreseeable risks included post‑conflict political disintegration and extremist 

violence in Iraq, the inadequacy of US plans, the UK’s inability to exert 
significant influence on US planning and, in the absence of UN authorisation 


The Report of the Iraq Inquiryfor the administration and reconstruction of post‑conflict Iraq, the reluctance 
of potential international partners to contribute to the post‑conflict effort. 

•  The Government, which lacked both clear Ministerial oversight of post‑conflict 

strategy, planning and preparation, and effective co‑ordination between 
government departments, failed to analyse or manage those risks adequately.

•  Mr Blair, who recognised the significance of the post‑conflict phase, did 
not press President Bush for definite assurances about US plans, did not 
consider or seek advice on whether the absence of a satisfactory plan called 
for reassessment of the terms of the UK’s engagement and did not make 
agreement on such a plan a condition of UK participation in military action.

also underestimated the need for sustained communication of key strategic 
messages to inform public opinion about the objectives and progress of the 
military campaign, including in Iraq.

•  For any future military operations, arrangements to agree and disseminate key 
strategic messages need to be put in place, in both London and on the ground, 
before operations begin. 

•  The UK acceded to the post‑invasion US request that it assume leadership of a 
military Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompassing four provinces in southern 
Iraq, a position it then held for six years, without a formal Ministerial decision and 
without carrying out a robust analysis of the strategic implications for the UK or 
the military’s capacity to support the UK’s potential obligations in the region.

•  The UK struggled from the start to have a decisive effect on the Coalition 
Provisional Authority’s (CPA’s) policies, even though it was fully implicated 
in its decisions as joint Occupying Power.


Executive Summary•  US and UK strategies for Iraq began to diverge almost immediately after the 
conflict. Although the differences were managed, by early 2007 the UK was 
finding it difficult to play down the divergence, which was, by that point, striking. 

•  The UK missed clear opportunities to reconsider its military approach in

Forces reached the view that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that 
it would make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it 
might have greater effect. 

•  From July 2005 onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were made 
under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan. Although Iraq 
remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of 
a substantial reinforcement of its forces there. 

•  The UK’s plans to reduce troop levels depended on the transition of lead 

responsibility for security to the Iraqi Security Forces, even as the latter’s ability 
to take on that responsibility was in question. 

•  The UK spent time and energy on rewriting strategies, which tended to describe

Reconstruction

required in Iraq. 

•  The UK failed to plan or prepare for the major reconstruction programme 
•  Reconstruction was the third pillar in a succession of UK strategies for Iraq. 
The Government never resolved how reconstruction would support broader 
UK objectives. 

•  Following the resignation of Ms Clare Short, the International Development 

Secretary, and the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1483 in May 2003, 
DFID assumed leadership of the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq. DFID would 
subsequently define, within the framework established by the Government, the 
scope and nature of that effort.

•  At key points, DFID should have considered strategic questions about the scale, 
•  The US‑led Coalition Provisional Authority excluded the UK from discussions 
on oil policy and on disbursements from the Development Fund for Iraq. 
•  Many of the failures which affected pre‑invasion planning and preparation 

persisted throughout the post‑conflict period. They included poor 


The Report of the Iraq Inquiryinter‑departmental co‑ordination, inadequate civilian military co‑operation and 
a failure to use resources coherently.

•  An unstable and insecure environment made it increasingly difficult to make 

progress on reconstruction. Although staff and contractors developed innovative 
ways to deliver projects and manage risks, the constraints were never 
overcome. Witnesses to the Inquiry identified some successes, in particular in 
building the capacity of central Iraqi Government institutions and the provincial 
government in Basra. 

•  Lessons learned through successive reviews of the UK approach to post‑conflict 
reconstruction and stabilisation, in Iraq and elsewhere, were not applied in Iraq.

De‑Ba’athification

•  Early decisions on the form of de‑Ba’athification and its implementation had

•  There was no qualitative way for the UK to measure progress. The focus on the

of officers, was simplistic and gave a misleading sense of comfort.

an Iraq‑wide approach.

•  After 2006, the UK’s determination to withdraw from Iraq meant that aspirations 
for the Iraqi Security Forces were lowered to what would be “good enough” for 
Iraq. It was never clear what that meant in practice.


Executive Summary•  The development of the Iraqi Army was considerably more successful than 
that of the Iraqi Police Service. But the UK was still aware before it withdrew 
from Iraq that the Iraqi Army had not been sufficiently tested. The UK was not 
confident that the Iraqi Army could maintain security without support.

Resources
Section 13.1:

•  The direct cost of the conflict in Iraq was at least £9.2bn (the equivalent of 
£11.83bn in 2016). In total, 89 percent of that was spent on military operations. 
•  The Government’s decision to take part in military action against Iraq was not 

affected by consideration of the potential financial cost to the UK of the invasion 
or the post‑conflict period.

•  Ministers were not provided with estimates of military conflict and post‑conflict 
costs, or with advice on their affordability, when decisions were taken on the 
scale of the UK’s military contribution to a US‑led invasion of Iraq, and on the 
UK’s role in the post‑conflict period. They should have been.

did not constrain the UK military’s ability to conduct operations in Iraq. 

•  The controls imposed by the Treasury on the MOD’s budget in September 2003 
•  The Government was slow to recognise that Iraq was an enduring operation, 
and to adapt its funding arrangements to support both military operations and 
civilian activities. 

•  The arrangements for securing funding for civilian activities could be slow 
and unpredictable. Some high‑priority civilian activities were funded late or 
only in part. 

Military equipment (post‑conflict)
Section 14.1:

•  Between 2003 and 2009, UK forces in Iraq faced gaps in some key capability 
areas, including protected mobility, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition 
and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) and helicopter support. 

•  It was not sufficiently clear which person or department within the MOD had 

responsibility for identifying and articulating capability gaps.


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry•  Delays in providing adequate medium weight Protected Patrol Vehicles (PPVs) 

and the failure to meet the needs of UK forces in MND(SE) for ISTAR and 
helicopters should not have been tolerated.

•  The MOD was slow in responding to the developing threat in Iraq from 

Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The range of protected mobility options 
available to commanders in MND(SE) was limited. Although work had begun 
before 2002 to source an additional PPV, it was only ordered in July 2006 
following Ministerial intervention. 

•  Funding was not a direct barrier to the identification and deployment of 

additional solutions to the medium weight PPV gap. But it appears that the 
longer‑term focus of the Executive Committee of the Army Board on the 
Future Rapid Effect System programme inhibited it from addressing the more 
immediate issue related to medium weight PPV capability.

•  The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan had a material impact on the 
availability of key capabilities for deployment to Iraq, particularly helicopters 
and ISTAR.

Civilian personnel

•  Before the invasion of Iraq, the Government had made only minimal

the level of its ambition in Iraq.

•  The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that the Government recognised its 
duty of care to UK‑based and locally engaged civilians in Iraq. A significant effort 
was made to keep civilians safe in a dangerous environment.

Service Personnel
Sections 16.1 to 16.3:

•  In 2002, the UK military was already operating at, and in some cases beyond, 
the limits of the guidelines agreed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. As 
a result, the Harmony Guidelines were being breached for some units and 
specialist trades.

•  The Government’s decision to contribute a military force to a US‑led invasion 
of Iraq inevitably increased the risk that more Service Personnel would be put

Service Personnel was not a consideration in the decision.

healthcare and rehabilitative care available to Service Personnel over the course 
of Op TELIC. 

•  Most of the contacts between the MOD and bereaved families were conducted 
with sensitivity. In a few cases, they were not. The MOD progressively improved 
how it engaged with and supported bereaved families, in part driven by 
consistent public and Ministerial pressure.

•  The Government’s decision in 2006 to deploy a second medium scale force

than react to them. 

•  The MOD made a number of improvements to the Board of Inquiry process, but 

some proposals for more substantive reform (including the introduction of an 
independent member) were not fully explored. The MOD significantly improved 
the way it communicated with and supported bereaved families in relation to 
military investigations and inquests. 

•  The MOD was less effective at providing support to Service Personnel who were 
mobilised individually (a category which included almost all Reservists) and their 
families, than to formed units. 

Civilian casualties

•  The Inquiry considers that a Government has a responsibility to make every 

reasonable effort to understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions 
on civilians. 

•  In the months before the invasion, Mr Blair emphasised the need to minimise 
the number of civilian casualties arising from an invasion of Iraq. The MOD’s 
responses offered reassurance based on the tight targeting procedures 
governing the air campaign.

period to determine the number of civilian casualties and the broader effects of 
military operations on civilians. More time was devoted to the question of which 
department should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than it 
was to efforts to determine the actual number. 

•  The Government’s consideration of the issue of Iraqi civilian casualties was 

driven by its concern to rebut accusations that Coalition Forces were responsible 
for the deaths of large numbers of civilians, and to sustain domestic support for 
operations in Iraq. 

Lessons

particular set of circumstances which are unlikely to be repeated. Unlike other instances 
in which military force has been used, the invasion was not prompted by the aggression 
of another country or an unfolding humanitarian disaster. The lessons drawn by the 
Inquiry on the pre‑conflict element of this Report are therefore largely context‑specific 
and embedded in its conclusions. Lessons on collective Ministerial decision‑making, 
where the principles identified are enduring ones, are an exception. They, and other 
lessons which have general application, are set out below.

military action might achieve and against any tendency to play down the risks. A realistic 
assessment of the possibilities and limitations of armed force, and of the challenges of

see the risk of combining in the September dossier the JIC’s assessment of intelligence 
and other evidence with the interpretation and presentation of the evidence in order to 
make the case for policy action.


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry837.  The nature of the two functions is fundamentally different. As can be seen from 
the JIC Assessments quoted in, and published with, this report, they contain careful 
language intended to ensure that no more weight is put on the evidence than it can bear. 
Organising the evidence in order to present an argument in the language of Ministerial 
statements produces a quite different type of document. 

firmness of the evidence about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in order to influence 
opinion and “make the case” for action to disarm Iraq has produced a damaging legacy, 
including undermining trust and confidence in Government statements, particularly those 
which rely on intelligence which cannot be independently verified.

the evidence, at least in part, depends on inferential judgements drawn from necessarily 
incomplete intelligence, it may be more difficult to secure support for the Government’s 
position and agreement to action.

decisions will be infrequent. But, from the evidence on the compilation of the September 
dossier, the lessons for any similar exercise in future would be:

•  The need for clear separation of the responsibility for analysis and assessment 
of intelligence from the responsibility for making the argument for a policy.
•  The importance of precision in describing the position. In the case of the 

September dossier, for instance, the term “programme” was used to describe 
disparate activities at very different stages of maturity. There was a “programme” 
to extend the range of the Al Samoud missile. There was no “programme” 
in any meaningful sense to develop and produce nuclear weapons. Use of 
the shorthand CW or BW in relation to Iraq’s capability obscured whether the 
reference was to weapons or warfare. Constant use of the term “weapons of 
mass destruction” without further clarification obscured the differences between 
the potential impact of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and the 
ability to deliver them effectively. For example, there would be a considerable 
difference between the effects of an artillery shell filled with mustard gas, which 
is a battlefield weapon, and a long‑range ballistic missile with a chemical or 
biological warhead, which is a weapon of terror. 

•  The need to identify and accurately describe the confidence and robustness of 
the evidence base. There may be evidence which is “authoritative” or which puts 
an issue “beyond doubt”; but there are unlikely to be many circumstances when 
those descriptions could properly be applied to inferential judgements relying on 
intelligence. 

•  The need to be explicit about the likelihood of events. The possibility of Iraq 

producing and using an improvised nuclear device was, rightly, omitted from the 
dossier. But the claim that Iraq could build a nuclear weapon within one to two 


Executive Summaryyears if it obtained fissile material and other essential components from foreign 
sources was included without addressing how feasible and likely that would 
be. In addition, the Executive Summary gave prominence to the International 
Institute of Strategic Studies suggestion that Iraq would be able to assemble 
nuclear weapons within months if it could obtain fissile material, without 
reference to the material in the main text of the dossier which made clear that 
the UK took a very different view.

and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq’s capabilities and intent continued to be 
used to prepare briefing material to support Government statements in a way which 
conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of the intelligence.


Sir Percy Cradock wrote in his history of the JIC that:

“Ideally, intelligence and policy should be close but distinct. Too distinct and 
assessments become an in‑growing, self‑regarding activity, producing little or no 
work of interest to the decision‑makers ... Too close a link and policy begins to play 
back on estimates, producing the answers the policy makers would like ... The 
analysts become courtiers, whereas their proper function is to report their findings 
... without fear or favour. The best arrangement is intelligence and policy in separate 
but adjoining rooms, with communicating doors and thin partition walls ...”280 


“The reason why we have a Joint Intelligence Committee which is separate from the 
intelligence agencies is precisely so that those who are obtaining the intelligence are

strengths of our system compared with most other systems around the world.”281

in safeguarding the independence and impartiality of intelligence”; and that the 
“independence and impartiality of its own role” was “of the utmost importance”. 
It recommended that Ministers should “bear in mind at all times the importance of 
ensuring that the JIC is free of all political pressure”.

assessments on a range of issues of importance to national interests.”283

in advance on how decision‑making and governance will operate within an alliance or 
coalition. The UK normally acts with allies, as it did in Iraq. Within the NATO Alliance, 
the rules and mechanisms for decision‑taking and the sharing of responsibility have 
been developed over time and are well understood. The Coalition in Iraq, by contrast, 


The Report of the Iraq Inquirywas an ad hoc alliance. The UK tried to establish some governance principles in 
the Memorandum of Understanding proposed to the US, but did not press the point. 
This led the UK into the uncomfortable and unsatisfactory situation of accepting 
shared responsibility without the ability to make a formal input to the process of 
decision‑making. 

The maximum impact needs to be made in the early weeks and months, or opportunities 
missed may be lost for ever. It is very difficult to recover from a slow or damaging start. 

decision‑makers – Ministers, Chiefs of Staff, senior officials – must have a flow of 
accurate and frank reporting. A “can do” attitude is laudably ingrained in the UK Armed 
Forces – a determination to get on with the job, however difficult the circumstances – 
but this can prevent ground truth from reaching senior ears. At times in Iraq, the bearers 
of bad tidings were not heard. On several occasions, decision‑makers visiting Iraq 
(including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the General Staff) 
found the situation on the ground to be much worse than had been reported to them. 
Effective audit mechanisms need to be used to counter optimism bias, whether through 
changes in the culture of reporting, use of multiple channels of information – internal 
and external – or use of visits. 

and financing – and the ability to change tactics to deal with adverse developments 
on the ground. In Iraq, that flexibility was lost after the parallel deployment to Helmand 
province in Afghanistan, which both constrained the supply of equipment (such as 
ISTAR) and took away the option of an effective reinforcement. Any decision to deploy 
to the limit of capabilities entails a high level of risk. In relation to Iraq, the risks involved 
in the parallel deployment of two enduring medium scale operations were not examined 
with sufficient rigour and challenge. 

was required in Iraq is a complex task. It needs dedicated leadership by someone with 
time, energy and influence. It cannot realistically be done by a Prime Minister alone, but 
requires a senior Minister with lead responsibility who has access to the Prime Minister 
and is therefore able to call on his or her influence in resolving problems or conflicts. 
A coherent inter‑departmental effort, supported by a structure able to hold departments 
to account, is required to support such a Minister.

Reconstruction
comparable to those in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 must be that this is an area where 
progress will be extremely difficult.


Executive Summary867.  Better planning and preparation for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq would not 
necessarily have prevented the events that unfolded in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. 
It would not have been possible for the UK to prepare for every eventuality. Better 
plans and preparation could have mitigated some of the risks to which the UK and Iraq 
were exposed between 2003 and 2009 and increased the likelihood of achieving the 
outcomes desired by the UK and the Iraqi people.

reconstruction, later expanded to include the broader concept of stabilisation, resulted 
in a series of changes to the UK’s approach to post‑conflict operations. Despite those 
changes, many of the shortcomings that characterised the UK Government’s approach to 
pre‑conflict planning and preparation in 2002 and early 2003 persisted after the invasion.

De‑Ba’athification
those closely identified with that regime from continuing to hold positions of influence 
in public life. The development of plans which minimise undesired consequences, 
which are administered with justice and which are based on a robust understanding 
of the social context in which they will be implemented, should be an essential part 
of preparation for any post‑conflict phase. This should include measures designed to 
address concerns within the wider population, including those of the victims of the old 
regime, and to promote reconciliation.

Executive SummarySecurity Sector Reform

questions should drive a robust debate about how security requirements might change 
over time. 

internal security, policing and criminal justice is essential. But those models cannot 
be considered in isolation because what works in one country will not necessarily 
work in another which may have very different traditions. It is therefore critical for the 
SSR strategy to take full account of the history, culture and inherited practices of the 
country or region in question. The strategy also needs to be informed by the views and 
aspirations of the local population.

population, the indicators of that success should be obvious. It should rarely concentrate 
on a one‑dimensional set of numbers but instead be a more qualitative and rounded 
assessment.

Resources

applies equally to military operations. When evaluating military options it is appropriate 
to consider financial risk alongside other forms of risk. While governments will rarely 
wish to preclude options solely on the basis of cost, they must also recognise that, over 
time, cost may become an issue and make it difficult to sustain a military operation over 
the longer term. 

identify the budget(s) that will provide those resources, and confirm that those resources 
are available. 

should address the impact of the different mechanisms used to fund military operations 
and civilian activities and the extent to which those mechanisms provide perverse 
incentives for military action by making it easier to secure funding for agreed military 
operations than for civilian activities. 


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry891.  A government should also address its explicit and implicit financial policy that, 
while there should be no constraint on the provision of funding for military operations, 
it is reasonable that for the same civilian/military operation, departments should find 
funding for new civilian activities from within their existing budgets, which are likely to be 
fully allocated to existing departmental priorities.

of a coherent UK strategy. Once allocations were made from that budget to individual 
departments, the allocations would be managed within departments’ legal and policy 
constraints. Such an arrangement should: 

•  ensure that UK strategy was resourced; 
•  promote joint working;
•  minimise the potential for gaming;
•  be able to respond to in‑year priorities; and 
•  reduce the amount of time that Ministers and senior officials need to spend

lay during Op TELIC. That is unacceptable. The roles and responsibilities for identifying 
and articulating capability gaps in enduring operations must be clearly defined,

addressed after the period covered by this Inquiry.

requirements and long‑term defence programmes is right, particularly to meet an 
evolving threat on current operations.

setting out the acceptable level of risk to UK forces and who was responsible for 
managing that risk. The MOD has suggested to the Inquiry that successive policies 
defining risk ownership and governance more clearly have addressed that absence, 
and that wider MOD risk management processes have also been revised. In any future 
operation the level of force protection required to meet the assessed threat needs to be 
addressed explicitly. 

Civilian personnel
the UK’s strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation. Some 
of those changes, including the establishment of a deployable UK civilian stand‑by 
capability, are the direct result of lessons learned from serious shortcomings in the 
deployment of civilian personnel in post‑conflict Iraq.

arrangements throughout the Iraq campaign, leading to concerns about breaks 
in continuity, loss of momentum, lack of institutional memory and insufficient local 
knowledge.

Standardisation of all aspects of those deployments may not be appropriate, but greater 
harmonisation of departmental policies should be considered wherever possible. 
The same approach should be applied to locally engaged (LE) staff.

make and will face particular risks in insecure environments. 


The Report of the Iraq Inquiry906.  All civilian deployments should be assessed and reviewed against a single, 
rigorous, cross‑government framework for risk management. The framework should 
provide the means for the Government as a whole to strike an effective balance between 
security and operational effectiveness, and to take timely decisions on the provision of 
appropriate security measures.
